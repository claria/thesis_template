# Thesis LaTeX template

## Dependencies
- biber (for biblatex)
- latexmk (for automating the pdf generation using the appropriate sequence)

## Build

The build of the pdf is issued using the commands `make thesis` and `make book`
which build the web and book versions of the thesis. The only difference between
the web/book versions are symmetric/asymmetric page margins and colored/black
hyperlinks.
